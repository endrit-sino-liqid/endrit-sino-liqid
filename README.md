- 👋 Hi, I’m @endrit-sino-liqid
- 👀 I’m interested in problem-solving, diagramming, presentations, what motivates people, chess, football, hiking & mountaineering, relationships, not so much about pets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about behavioural biology, as a hobby of course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps that improve privacy and security of data for users.
- 📫 How to reach me? My personal email endrit.sino@gmail.com would be the best option for now.
